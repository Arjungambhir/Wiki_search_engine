1.Code is present in 2019900004_SRC_CODE folder 

2.use jar files to run and test the application

3.FOllow steps to run jar files and follow the sequence 

--> navigate temial to folder where jar placed 

--> Run CreateIndex.jar with 2 arguments 1.path to wikidump.xml file 2.index folder path 

example : java -jar CreateIndex.jar "/home/vampi/Desktop/IIITH/IRE/project/enwiki-latest-pages-articles26.xml"  "/home/vampi/Desktop/H/"
here "/home/vampi/Desktop/IIITH/IRE/project/enwiki-latest-pages-articles26.xml" and "/home/vampi/Desktop/H/" are my arguments for wikidump and 
index folder path 

we will get time required to create index at end with current testing it is approx 55-60 sec
and size of indexes are 24-25 MB 
folder provided for index creation we are also creating a meta folder under it which is not index folder so its size needs to be 
substracted from total folder size




--> create a file which has list of queries say file name is new (it can be anything)
--> Run SearchQuery.jar with 3 arguments 1.path of index folder (same where we created above)
					 2.path of file where queries are present 
					 3.path of output file (no need to create this one just give path file will be created automatically)


example : java -jar SearchQuery.jar "/home/vampi/Desktop/H/"  "/home/vampi/Desktop/new"  "/home/vampi/Desktop/output"
here 3 are arguments are as mentioned above 

we will get required output as list of related documents (currently its not limited it will give all) in file which we provided as arg 3 

test done for this : 
1. Input file data    :  alluarjun
                         Kim Hyeon-Woo


2.Results            

Time taken to search result for  2  Queries ..-->>0.082secs
{found related documents to query alluarjun are ---->>>  =[42661250, 42660312], 
found related documents to query Kim Hyeon-Woo are ---->>>  =[42645839, 42652026, 42573791, 42617474, 42654890, 42567205, 42657122, 42625895, 42621845, 42638296]}


---Note : currently search is not accurately ranked so may be you will get result in diffrent rank but all obtained results are relative only
